			<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>My biggest interest is in programming, to be able to develop my apps and programs to control and collect data from devices. My journey started when the 3d printers come out and you have to load the programs to the Arduino board that is the mainboard to control the devices so from there I build my own 3d printer and I have a great interest to learn more in programming.</p>
				<p>I was not able to study at university previously.  I recently received my citizenship, this way I am now in a position to start university; as a working dad, one of the chances that I have are the online courses and I decided to do with RMIT after a bit of research and references from students that did their courses at RMIT.</p>
				<p>I'm expecting that after I have finished the course to possess a solid knowledge base on IT, which can increase my employability and have a chance to be a part of a development team to further advance on the path of being capable to create my own programs and apps.</p>

			<h2>Strengths</h2>
			<p>Knowledgeable – Debaters rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the Debater personality type just find it fascinating.</p>
			<p>Quick Thinkers – Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit.</p>
			<p>Original – Having little attachment to tradition, Debater personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, Debaters respond with unabashed glee.</p>
			<p>Excellent Brainstormers – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to Debaters as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work and presenting ever more possibilities, Debaters are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.</p>
			<p>
			Charismatic – People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.
			</p>
			<p>
			Energetic – When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, Debaters can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.</p>

				<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
			</div>	
			<div class="artParagraph">
			
			<p>Very Argumentative – If there’s anything Debaters enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.</p>
			<p>Insensitive – Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.</p>
			<p>Intolerant – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with.</p>
			<p>Can Find It Difficult to Focus – The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.</p>
			<p>Dislike Practical Matters – Debaters are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.</p>
