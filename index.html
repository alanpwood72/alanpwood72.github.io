				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>My biggest interest is in programming, to be able to develop my apps and programs to control and collect data from devices. My journey started when the 3d printers come out and you have to load the programs to the Arduino board that is the mainboard to control the devices so from there I build my own 3d printer and I have a great interest to learn more in programming.</p>
				<p>I was not able to study at university previously.  I recently received my citizenship, this way I am now in a position to start university; as a working dad, one of the chances that I have are the online courses and I decided to do with RMIT after a bit of research and references from students that did their courses at RMIT.</p>
				<p>I'm expecting that after I have finished the course to possess a solid knowledge base on IT, which can increase my employability and have a chance to be a part of a development team to further advance on the path of being capable to create my own programs and apps.</p>

				<h2>Strengths</h2>
				<p>Knowledgeable – Debaters rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the Debater personality type just find it fascinating.</p>
				<p>Quick Thinkers – Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit.</p>
				<p>Original – Having little attachment to tradition, Debater personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, Debaters respond with unabashed glee.</p>
				<p>Excellent Brainstormers – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to Debaters as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work and presenting ever more possibilities, Debaters are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.</p>
				<p>
				Charismatic – People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.
				</p>
				<p>
				Energetic – When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, Debaters can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.</p>
			</div>
		</article>
		<article class="container">
			<div class ="artTitle">
				<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
			</div>	
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>Very Argumentative – If there’s anything Debaters enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.</p>
				<p>Insensitive – Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.</p>
				<p>Intolerant – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with.</p>
				<p>Can Find It Difficult to Focus – The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.</p>
				<p>Dislike Practical Matters – Debaters are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.</p>

				<h2>Pragmatist style</h2>
				<p>Pragmatists need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world. Abstract concepts and games are of limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas into action. Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. They may act quickly and confidently on ideas, getting straight to the point, and may lose patience with lengthy discussions.</p>

				<h2>Activist style</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>Activists like to immerse themselves fully in new experiences. They enjoy the ‘here and now’, and tend to be open minded, enthusiastic and flexible. They have a tendency to act first and consider the consequences later, and they often seek to centre activities around themselves.</p>

				<h2>Theorist style</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>Theorists like to think through problems in a logical manner. They value rationality and objectivity, and like to assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories. They are disciplined, aiming to fit things into a rational order. They are often keen on basic assumptions, principles, theories, models and systems thinking.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>For my project, I decided to build an audio sense that operates a relay to activate or deactivate any device when sound is detected on the input of the sensor, it can be used in multiple applications, one of them being when you get home and connect your music device to the sound system it will automatically turn on the high power amplifier, vice versa when no sound is detected and it will shut down its base mainly in Arduino board as a decision-maker, Arduino compatible relay and the analogous sensor that I will build from scratch for the project as well as the 3d printed enclosure parts.</p>
			</div>
		</article>
		<article class="container">
			<div class ="artTitle">
				<h2>Motivation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>This project can be used for multiple applications where the sound activated switch is needed; this is not a voice-activated switch since the source input is used through an audio jack, there are many commercial devices available at a high price, I'm developing this unit mainly to be used at home where anyone with small electronic knowledge will be able to download the project as well as ordering the board and parts to be assembled or even buy at low cost with the pre-assembled product. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Description</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>This project has one input the audio sensor and one output that is a relay with a normal close, normal open, and a common connection that is used to wire the device that will be switched.
				The entire electronic is powered by a 5 volts source, connected to the Arduino board micro USB port, and redistribute to the relay as well as the audio sensor board.
				When an audio signal is at the input of the stereo jack the signal is amplified by an operational amplifier chip, this amplified signal is analog and it is converted to digital 0 and 5 volts so it can be used to trigger the Arduino input. 
				When 5 volts are at the Arduino input the code will check for a period to make sure the input voltage still high not just a noise spike, after that it will change the output to high which will make the relay board activate the relay.
				When not, the audio signal is at the input of the stereo jack, the voltage drops to 0 “zero” at the Arduino input and the code will check for 20 seconds or more to make sure that there is no input not just a quiet time in the sound source, after that the output will become low and the relay board changes the status back to the initial position and the cycle repeats.

				<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>The initial design would be using <a href="https://easyeda.com/" target="_blank">EasyEDA</a> online PCB design & circuit simulator, this software is free to use, you can download the design and use it to create your own PCB or directly order it through EasyEDA, the PCB usually takes one to two weeks to be delivered. The next step is to prototype it in a breadboard then transfer it to a board. The code will be programmed and transferred through <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino IDE</a> to the Arduino board. For the enclosure I will be using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators" target="_blank">Fusion 360</a> to design the 3d object to be converted to an STL file and printed using a 3d printer. Fusion 360 is free to use for students as well as a hobby.</p>
			</div>

		<article class="container">
			<div class ="artTitle">
				<h2>Skills Required</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>The project requires basic knowledge on electronics to adapt the operational amplifier and convert the analog signal to zero when it is low and five when it is high, also some skill soldering electronics component. To program the Arduino board there is plenty of information on the Arduino site and the internet. To be able to produce the enclosure, basic 3d model design skill is required and again there is a great tutorial on the internet on how to create 3d objects in Fusion 360. To print the 3d model, if you do not own a 3d printer to produce the part, 3d printed parts can be ordered online for a low cost.</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="artParagraph">
				<p>I am not expecting to make money from it, only the satisfaction when others can use a product that I have built and shared. Point to be taken is that I will be learning a lot in the process of building it.</p>
